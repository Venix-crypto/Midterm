            K-Meleon browser was an open source browser that released in August of 2000.It's engine is based on mozilla's gecko engine. It was the first to use the engine outside of netscape, even predating firefox and the nostalgic Seamonkey browser. K-meleon runs on legacy hardware that browsers no longer support. So keep that in mind. K-meleon can still be used today
