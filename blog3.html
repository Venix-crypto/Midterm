            Did you know that the spindash in sonic 2 added due to user complaints? According to Sega Magizine who interviewed Yuji Naka in 1997, the developers addressed the issues that the users were complaining about. Some gamers were having a hard time getting passed the "loop-de-loops". So they added spin-dash to Sonic 2 to address the issue.
