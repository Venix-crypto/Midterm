            I started playing video games at the age of 4 my first consoles that ive ever played was a super nintendo. This was the first console that i've played after putting my hands on arcade cabinets at a young age which led me to love fighting games. Killer instinct was the very first game that i wanted to be good at and it was made possible due to its' release on the Super Nintendo back in 1994. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Here's a link to that console</a>
